  "readme": "# HTML_CodeSniffer README\n\nHTML_CodeSniffer is a client-side JavaScript that checks a HTML document or source code, and detects violations of a defined coding standard.\n\nIt can be used in two ways. Called directly in JavaScript source, HTML_CodeSniffer will provide a list of known and potential violations to the calling script. It also comes with a pop-up auditor interface, accessible via a bookmarklet, letting you browse through messages emitted from one of the defined standards. Where possible, the auditor also points you to the HTML element causing the problem.\n\nHTML_CodeSniffer is released under a BSD-style licence. For more information, please see the file \"licence.txt\".\n\n## Which standards and sniffs does HTML_CodeSniffer include?\n\nHTML_CodeSniffer comes with standards and sniffs that cover the three conformance levels of the W3C [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20), and the U.S. [Section 508](http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=stdsdoc) legislation.\n\n## Contributing and reporting issues\n\nTo report any issues with using HTML_CodeSniffer, please use the [HTML_CodeSniffer Issue Tracker](http://github.com/squizlabs/HTML_CodeSniffer/issues).\n\nContributions to the HTML_CodeSniffer code base are also welcome: please create a fork of the main repository, then submit your modified code through a [Pull Request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) for review. A Pull Request also automatically creates an issue in the Issue Tracker, so if you have code to contribute, you do not need to do both.\n\n## More Information\n\nMore information on HTML_CodeSniffer can be found on its GitHub site, [http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/](http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/). This site provides:\n\n- Information on the tests performed (and messages emitted) by HTML_CodeSniffer's standards, organised by conformance level and Success Criterion;\n- A source test area that allows you to try out HTML_CodeSniffer with your own HTML source code; and\n- A link to the HTML_CodeSniffer bookmarklet, letting you check other pages using the pop-up auditor interface.\n",
